Coley, I am working on structure elucidation of mass spectra using neural networks. My work is supported by the Zeno Karl Schindler Master‚Äôs Thesis Grant, Excellence Scholarship and Opportunity Programme and the Swiss European Mobility Programme.\n[24/03] I started working as a research intern in the Laboratory of Artificial Chemical Intelligence (LIAC) at EPFL! I will be working with Philippe Schwaller and Andres M. Bran on large language model agents in heterogeneous catalysis. Our work won a poster award at the Faraday Discussions in data-driven discovery in the chemical sciences in Oxford, UK.\n[23/09] I am starting my master‚Äôs studies in chemistry at ETH Zurich, supported by the Excellence Scholarship and Opportunity Program (ESOP) by the ETH Foundation."
