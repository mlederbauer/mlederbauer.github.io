*Large Language Models go Chemistry!*
As part of the [global LLM Hackathon for Applications in Chemistry and Materials Science](https://medium.com/@blaiszik/llms-to-accelerate-discovery-in-materials-science-and-chemistry-refections-on-a-hackathon-b8364ca32242), our team (Dieter Plessers, Philippe Schwaller and me) built a tool to automatically generate glossaries from any PDF, in particular scientific publications, as a tool to help scientists create effective proposals. In a case study that we set up during the two-day hackathon, we investigated publications on Zeolites and were excited to rediscover common relations in that area of chemistry. On a technical level, we built a simple large language model agent to parse text from a publicatin and systematically identify and define keywords of relevance. We even began to set up a LaTeX extension to create a glossary simply by the command `\printglossary` (just like `\printbibliography`).

As a "cherry on top", we created a tool to extract and link keywords in the publication via a knowledge graph. Neo4J awarded us with the Knowledge Graph Prize, as outlined in a recent newsletter issue [here](https://neo4j.com/blog/this-week-in-neo4j-podcast-testing-knowledge-graph-genai-and-more/).

We are honored that our project headlined the medium post on ["How to Use LLMs to Accelerate Scientific Discovery"](https://medium.com/@blaiszik/llms-to-accelerate-discovery-in-materials-science-and-chemistry-refections-on-a-hackathon-b8364ca32242) by Ben Blaiszik! A preprint of the work of all fantastic teams is in preparation. We thank all organizers for setting up such a fantastic hackathon experience.
